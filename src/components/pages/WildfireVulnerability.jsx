            This project is ongoing work in collaboration with Earth Lab and the states of Colorado and Wyoming, funded by the NSF Ascend Engine. Because of the nature of the project, I can't share key results yet, but I'm excited to give an overview.

            The goal is to understand the vulnerability of the built environment in the Wildland–Urban Interface (WUI). We have a large interdisciplinary team—about eight people, including data scientists, wildfire experts, remote sensing scientists, and AI engineers. It's been incredibly impressive to see how this diverse group operates and the range of datasets we're working with. My role is split between data science—analyzing operational response forms—and AI engineering, helping to build the core model.

            Dr. Lise St. Denis has led the creation and cleanup of a dataset of ICS 209 Incident Status Summary response forms. She's taken a huge amount of unstructured data and brought order to it. However, some of the "narrative" fields still contain valuable information that's too difficult to formally schema-tize.

          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
            That's where Agentic AI and I come in. We're using LLMs to analyze those narrative fields and cross-reference the extracted insights with the FIRED fire perimeter dataset and the Google Geocoding API. The goal is to better understand how incident responders triage fire suppression at the WUI.

            I'm also contributing to the development of the AI model that will synthesize all of the data layers produced by our data science team.
